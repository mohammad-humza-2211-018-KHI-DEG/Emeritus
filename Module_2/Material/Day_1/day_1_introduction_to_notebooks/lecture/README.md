# Mathematical programming in python

## Day 1 - introduction to jupyter notebooks

### Remarks

1. The main files `notebook_basics.py` and `notebook_basics_2.py` contain both theory and practical exercises concerning jupyter notebooks. They should be treated as a mix of lecture and exercises.

2. The last cell of `notebook_basics.py` and `notebook_basics_2.py` is a styling cell which enriches the content of these notebooks. In case of any trouble with html formatting inside `notebook_basics.py` or `notebook_basics_2.py` just run this cell. If you want to change style of `html` tags from a notebook visit `root_of_this_course/style/custom.css`. To apply your changes remember to execute the styling cell!

3. Auxiliary directory `auxiliary` contains some custom files which are used in `notebook_basics.py` and `notebook_basics_2.py` to demonstrate notebook capabilities/tools/libraries.
