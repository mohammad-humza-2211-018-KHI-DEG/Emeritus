However, usage of these tools is not essential, and it is up to you to decide if you take advantage of them to realize the aim. E.g. you will be asked to handle dependencies and versioning using <i>poetry</i> but as <i>poetry</i> says on its <a href=\"https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry\">github page</a>:  \"Poetry replaces <i>setup.py</i>, <i>requirements.txt</i>, <i>setup.cfg</i>, <i>MANIFEST.in</i> and <i>Pipfile</i> with a simple <i>pyproject.toml</i> based project format\\\" so instead you can stay with traditional way using files listed in the quotation. Both approaches potentially have pros and cons: <i>poetry</i> is high lever  and thus it is easier to use but if something fails it might be tiresome to find the factor. On the other hand setting standard files (like <i>setup.py</i> etc.)  might take a while but you have control over almost everything. Similar situation is with <i>Makefile</i> vs <i>pre-commit</i> functionalities. Although <i>pre-commit</i> is more modern way to go still <i>Makefile</i> is commonly used for example to automate bash commands. </div>"
